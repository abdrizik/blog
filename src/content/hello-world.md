Welcome to my blog!

This is the traditional first post that every developer writes when starting something new. Think of it as a digital handshake—simple, friendly, and full of possibility.

## Why "Hello World"?

Every programming journey starts with these two magical words. But why?

> As developers, we write programs that take inputs and produce outputs. The simplest program would do nothing and just exit—but that's not very exciting!
>
> Instead, we print a welcoming message to the world.

Since 1972, programmers have been discovering new languages through the same simple phrase: **"Hello, World!"**

It's like a rite of passage. You type it, run it, see it work, and smile. That moment when your code first talks back to you? Pure magic. ✨

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

## Programmatic Greeting History

The story behind "Hello, World!" is quite fascinating:

> This programmatic greeting was made popular by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's "The C Programming Language" book, published in 1978.
>
> The sentence originally came from another publication, also by Brian Kernighan, "A Tutorial Introduction To The Language B", published in 1972.

**Fun fact:** This wasn't even the first example! The original publication first showed a program that printed `hi!`.

The reason for the change was interesting—the B programming language had a limitation where a single variable couldn't hold more than 4 characters. So "Hello, world!" required several calls to the printing function.

I learned about this fascinating programming history from the Learn Go with Pocket Sized Projects book:
